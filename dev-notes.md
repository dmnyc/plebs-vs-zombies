## Session: September 21, 2025

### Branch: scout-post-fix
Current status: Completed and ready for merge

### Changes Made

#### 1. Scout Mode UI Fixes
**Problem**: Two UI bugs in Scout Mode were preventing smooth user experience

**Fix 1: Social Post Modal Persistence** (`src/views/ScoutModeView.vue:828`)
- **Issue**: After posting a scout report, clicking "Scout Different User" didn't hide the post modal, blocking view of new scan results
- **Solution**: Added `this.showPostModal = false;` to `showScoutNewUser()` method
- **Location**: Line 828 in ScoutModeView.vue

**Fix 2: Start Scouting Button Stalling** (`src/views/ScoutModeView.vue:833-925`)
- **Issue**: "Start Scouting" button in modal would sometimes hang/stall when trying to scout a new user
- **Root Cause**: Async operations (service shutdown, reset, profile fetch) could hang without timeouts
- **Solution**: 
  - Added timeout handling to all async operations:
    - Stop scan: 5 second timeout
    - Service shutdown: 5 second timeout
    - Service reset: 3 second timeout
    - Profile fetch: 8 second timeout
  - Added `processingNewUser` flag to prevent duplicate calls
  - Added visual feedback: button shows "‚è≥ Processing..." when working
  - Added extensive console logging for debugging
  - Better error handling with specific timeout messages

**Files Modified**:
- `src/views/ScoutModeView.vue`
  - Added `processingNewUser: false` to data (line 654)
  - Updated `showScoutNewUser()` to reset modal state (line 828)
  - Enhanced `scoutNewUser()` with timeout handling (lines 833-925)
  - Updated modal button UI for processing state (lines 89-97)

#### 2. Zombie Score Analytics Chart
Created standalone visualization for Scout Mode data analysis

**Files Created**:
- `/charts/zombie-score-analysis-2025-09-14-to-20.html` - Interactive chart with zombie theme
- `/charts/README-chart-creation.md` - Documentation for creating future charts

**Chart Features**:
- Fully self-contained HTML file (no external dependencies except Chart.js CDN)
- Dark gradient background matching app theme
- Interactive bar chart showing zombie score distribution
- Color-coded bars: Green (low scores) ‚Üí Red (high scores)
- Zombie-themed styling with Creepster font and emojis (üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üëÅÔ∏è üîç üèπ üíÄ)
- Animated loading effects
- Summary statistics cards
- Timestamped throughout (filename, page title, headers, footer)

**Chart Data (Sept 14-20, 2025)**:
- Total scans: 40
- Average zombie score: 22%
- Range: 3.0% - 41.0%
- Distribution:
  - 3.0-6.8%: 2 plebs
  - 6.8-10.6%: 5 plebs
  - 10.6-14.4%: 2 plebs
  - 14.4-18.2%: 7 plebs
  - 18.2-22.0%: 1 pleb
  - 22.0-25.8%: 9 plebs
  - 25.8-29.6%: 7 plebs
  - 29.6-33.4%: 3 plebs
  - 33.4-37.2%: 3 plebs
  - 37.2-41.0%: 1 pleb

**GitHub Pages Setup**:
- Enabled GitHub Pages for repo
- Chart accessible at: https://dmnyc.github.io/plebs-vs-zombies/charts/zombie-score-analysis-2025-09-14-to-20.html
- Auto-deploys on push to main branch

**Chart Creation Process** (documented in `/charts/README-chart-creation.md`):
1. Collect Scout Mode scan data over time period
2. Calculate distribution across percentage ranges
3. Copy chart template and update:
   - Date ranges (filename, title, headers)
   - Data arrays (labels and counts)
   - Summary statistics
4. Test locally then push to GitHub
5. GitHub Pages auto-deploys

### Commit Messages

**Scout Mode Fixes** (on scout-post-fix branch):
```
Fix Scout Mode UI issues: modal persistence and button stalling

- Fix social post modal not disappearing when clicking "Scout Different User"
- Add timeout handling to prevent "Start Scouting" button from stalling
- Add visual feedback and duplicate call prevention for new user scouting
- Improve error handling with specific timeout messages

Resolves issues where users couldn't see new scan results due to persistent 
modals and unresponsive UI during user switching operations.
```

**Chart Creation** (on main branch):
- Initial: "Created standalone Zombie Score Chart"
- Update: "Update zombie-score-analysis-2025-09-14-to-20.html" (fixed average from 18.4% to 22%)

### Next Steps

1. **Merge scout-post-fix branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge scout-post-fix
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Optional: Clean up branch**:
   ```bash
   git branch -d scout-post-fix
   git push origin --delete scout-post-fix
   ```

3. **Future Chart Updates**:
   - Follow process in `/charts/README-chart-creation.md`
   - Use existing chart as template
   - Update date ranges and data
   - Push to GitHub for auto-deployment

### Technical Notes

**Scout Mode Architecture**:
- Main component: `src/views/ScoutModeView.vue`
- Service layer: `src/services/scoutService.js`
- Uses NDK for Nostr profile fetching
- Implements aggressive retry logic for network operations

**Known Considerations**:
- Profile fetching can timeout (8 seconds) if relays are slow
- Service shutdown/reset operations have 3-5 second timeouts
- All timeouts are gracefully handled with error messages
- Processing flag prevents concurrent scout operations

**Dev Environment**:
- Branch: scout-post-fix (ready for merge)
- Multiple dev servers running (can be cleaned up with `killall node` if needed)
- Git status: clean, all changes committed

### Files to Review Before Merge
- `src/views/ScoutModeView.vue` - Main Scout Mode component with UI fixes
- `charts/zombie-score-analysis-2025-09-14-to-20.html` - Data visualization
- `charts/README-chart-creation.md` - Chart creation documentation
