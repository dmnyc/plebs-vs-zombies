# Plebs vs. Zombies - Implementation Summary

## Project Structure

We've created a complete web application structure with the following components:

### Core Files
- `index.html` - Main HTML entry point
- `vite.config.js` - Vite configuration
- `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS configuration
- `postcss.config.js` - PostCSS configuration
- `package.json` - Project dependencies and scripts

### Vue Components
- `App.vue` - Main application component with navigation
- `src/views/` - Contains page components:
  - `DashboardView.vue` - Main dashboard with statistics
  - `ZombieHuntingView.vue` - Interface for hunting and purging zombies
  - `BackupsView.vue` - Backup management interface
  - `SettingsView.vue` - Application settings
- `src/components/` - Reusable UI components:
  - `ZombieStats.vue` - Displays zombie statistics with visualizations
  - `ZombieBatchSelector.vue` - Interface for selecting zombies to purge
  - `BackupManager.vue` - Manages backup creation and restoration

### Services
- `src/services/nostrService.js` - Handles Nostr communication
- `src/services/zombieService.js` - Manages zombie detection and purging
- `src/services/backupService.js` - Handles backup and restoration functions

### Assets
- `public/logo.svg` - Application logo
- `public/favicon.svg` - Application favicon
- `src/assets/styles/main.css` - Main stylesheet with Tailwind imports

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Nostr Integration**
   - Connection to Nostr extensions via NIP-07
   - Follow list retrieval
   - Activity data fetching
   - Batch unfollow event creation

2. **Zombie Detection**
   - Customizable thresholds for zombie classification
   - Scanning mechanism for detecting dormant accounts
   - Visualization of zombie statistics

3. **Backup System**
   - Local storage of follow list backups
   - Export/import functionality
   - Automatic backup scheduling

4. **Batch Processing**
   - Interface for selecting zombies to purge
   - Configurable batch sizes
   - Safety mechanisms for confirmation

5. **Statistics and Tracking**
   - Zombie purge history
   - Bandwidth savings calculations
   - Activity tracking

## Next Steps

To complete the implementation, you would need to:

1. Install the dependencies listed in package.json
2. Test the application with a real Nostr extension
3. Refine the UI based on user feedback
4. Add more comprehensive error handling
5. Implement additional features like:
   - Zombie rehabilitation (temporary unfollows)
   - Improved activity detection
   - Integration with more Nostr clients
   - Additional visualization options

## Deployment

The application can be deployed on any static hosting service after building with `npm run build`. The output will be in the `dist` directory.
