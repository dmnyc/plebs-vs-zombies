# Leaderboard Profile Image Fix

## Problem
Profile images on the leaderboard were occasionally disappearing, particularly for `npub1qnmamgyup683z9ehn40jrdgryjhn8qlpntwzqsrk8r80n3xspdrq4r245g` (The Bitcoin Street Journal).

## Root Cause
External profile picture URLs can become temporarily unavailable due to:
- Server downtime or maintenance
- Network issues
- Rate limiting
- Domain changes
- CORS issues

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Profile URL Verification (`scripts/fetch-leaderboard-profiles.js`)
Added automatic verification of profile picture URLs when fetching leaderboard data:

```javascript
async function verifyImageUrl(url) {
    if (!url) return null;
    try {
        const response = await fetch(url, { method: 'HEAD', timeout: 5000 });
        if (response.ok) return url;
        console.log(`⚠️  Image URL not accessible (${response.status}): ${url}`);
        return null;
    } catch (error) {
        console.log(`⚠️  Image URL verification failed: ${url} - ${error.message}`);
        return null;
    }
}
```

This ensures that only working image URLs are included in the leaderboard data.

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling (`public/leaderboard.html`)
Improved the HTML fallback mechanism with:

- **Lazy loading**: Images load only when needed, reducing initial page load
- **CORS support**: Added `crossorigin="anonymous"` for better cross-domain image handling
- **Error state tracking**: Prevents infinite error loops with `data-errored` flag
- **Graceful fallback**: Automatically shows initial letter placeholder when images fail

```html
<img src="..." class="profile-pic"
     crossorigin="anonymous"
     loading="lazy"
     onerror="if(!this.dataset.errored){this.dataset.errored='true';this.style.display='none';this.nextElementSibling.style.display='flex';}">
<div class="profile-pic-placeholder" style="display:none;">T</div>
```

## How to Use

### Running the Profile Fetcher
To update the leaderboard with verified profile pictures:

```bash
node scripts/fetch-leaderboard-profiles.js
```

The script will:
1. Fetch profile metadata from Nostr relays
2. Verify each profile picture URL is accessible
3. Output verified data ready to paste into `public/leaderboard.html`

### Updating the Leaderboard
1. Run the profile fetcher script
2. Copy the generated JavaScript array from the console output
3. Replace the `participants` array in `public/leaderboard.html` (starting around line 562)

## Prevention Strategy

### Regular Checks
Run the profile fetcher script periodically to:
- Verify all profile pictures are still accessible
- Update profile information if users change their Nostr profiles
- Remove broken image URLs proactively

### Monitoring
Watch for these warning messages in the script output:
```
⚠️  Image URL not accessible (404): https://...
⚠️  Image URL verification failed: https://...
```

### Best Practices
1. **Always run the verification script before updating the leaderboard**
2. **Check the script output for warnings about inaccessible URLs**
3. **The script will automatically set `picture: null` for failed URLs**
4. **The HTML will gracefully show a placeholder for missing images**

## Current Status
✅ All profile URLs have been verified (as of last run)
✅ Enhanced error handling is in place
✅ Automatic fallbacks are working
⚠️  Note: Antihumano's void.cat URL failed verification and was set to `null`

## Files Modified
- `scripts/fetch-leaderboard-profiles.js` - Added URL verification
- `public/leaderboard.html` - Enhanced error handling and fallback mechanism
