## Development Notes

### Adding Temporary Features
1. Always mark with `[TEMPORARY - October 2025 Competition]` comments
2. Document in this file under appropriate section
3. Keep changes modular and easy to remove
4. Avoid deep integration with core features

### Best Practices
- Prefer feature flags over conditional compilation
- Use separate components rather than modifying existing ones
- Keep competition logic isolated
- Document all changes thoroughly

---

## Archive Location (After Removal)

Final competition data will be archived in:
- `/archive/competitions/october-2025/`
  - Final leaderboard snapshot
  - Statistics and analytics
  - Screenshots and media
  - Participant list
